# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction

## 🧠 Objective
Predict which customers are likely to churn using machine learning models on a real-world telecom dataset.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle Telco Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- 7,043 customers
- Features: Demographics, account info, usage, contracts, payments

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib)
- ML Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

## 📈 Key Steps
1. Data cleaning and EDA
2. Feature encoding
3. Model training & evaluation
4. Feature importance analysis
5. Business insights

## ✅ Results
- Random Forest achieved **~80% accuracy**
- Top predictors: Contract type, tenure, monthly charges
- Suggested actions: Loyalty offers for short-tenure clients
